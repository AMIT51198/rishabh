 A typical essay contains many different kinds of information, often located
 in specialized parts or sections. Even short essays perform several different
 operations: introducing the argument, analyzing data, raising counterarguments, concluding. Introductions and conclusions have fixed places, but other parts don't. Counterargument, for example, may appear within a paragraph, as a free-standing section, as part of the beginning, or before the ending. Background material (historical context or biographical information, a summary of relevant theory or criticism, the definition of a key term) often appears at the beginning of the essay, between the
 introduction and the first analytical section, but might also appear near 
 the beginning of the specific section to which it's relevant.
